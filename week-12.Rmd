## Scene 1

**Prompt:** Create a fitted model object called `fit_1` using this formula or, if you want, a formula which you prefer. You are trying to model `age` as a function of various parameters.

age ~ sex + solo + primary_04 + primary_06 + treatment + sex:solo
                    
* Is this a causal or predictive model? Why?

* Interpret the fitted model. 

* Should we keep all these variables? And the interaction term?

* Are you surprised about the meaningfulness, or lack thereof, for the treatment variables?




## Scene 2

**Prompt:** Provide a posterior probability distribution for the expected difference in ages between those who live alone and those who do not. (Hint: Given that we are asking for an expected value, use `posterior_epred()`.)
